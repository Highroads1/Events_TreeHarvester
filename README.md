# Events_TreeHarvester
Tree growing and harvesting automatically using Event calls

To run, simply run .EXE

This application runs an object that grows a new tree at random intervals, and automatically harvests and logs the count.

*Learning experience: This was practice at using shared object references to use EVENT calls to run methods and update objects.
